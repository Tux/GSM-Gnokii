GSM::Gnokii
    A driver module to interface Perl with libgnokii. (abandoned)

DESCRIPTION
    This module is an attempt to interface perl with libgnokii to
    communicate with Nokia phones in a fast and gnokii compatable
    way. Much of the code is based on code in gnokii itself and
    on earlier code written by Konstantin Agouros.

    The module in this repo has been abandoned and the code has
    been donated to the Gnokii team. It is here just to not get
    lost.
