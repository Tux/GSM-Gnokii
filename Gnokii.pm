=head1 NAME

GSM::Gnokii - Perl extension libgnokii

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use GSM::Gnokii;
  
  $gsm = GSM::Gnokii->new ();
  $gsm->connect ();

  my $date_time    = $gsm->GetDateTime ();
  my $memory_state = $gsm->GetMemoryStatus ();
  my $address_book = $gsm->GetPhoneBook ("ME", 1, 0);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

GSM::Gnokii is a driver module to interface Perl with libgnokii.

=head1 MEMORYTYPES

The supported memory types are the ones that gnokii supports on the
different phone models, notably:

  ME  Internal memory of the mobile equipment
  SM  SIM card memory
  FD  Fixed dial numbers
  ON  Own numbers
  EN  Emergency numbers
  DC  Dialed numbers
  RC  Received calls
  MC  Missed calls
  LD  Last dialed numbers

For SMS, these are likely to be valid:

  IN  SMS Inbox
  OU  SMS Outbox, sent items
  OUS SMS Outbox, items to be sent
  AR  SMS Archive
  DR  SMS Drafts
  TE  SMS Templates
  F1  SMS Folder 1 (..20)

=head1 PARAMETERS AND RETURN VALUES

Most data used in below examples is made up and does not necessarily
reflect existing values. Values like "..." are indicating "some sort
of data, as my phone did not (yet) yield anything sensible to show.

When ranges are requested, if C<end> is C<0> or beyond the maximum
allowed location index, it is set to the known maximum, like gnokii
accepts "end" as range end. If a requested range includes empty slots
(like selecting all speed dials where location 4 is not set), the
empty slot returns C<undef>.

For methods that return a status C<$err>, the return code in C<$err> is

=over 4

=item undef

When undefined, you passed conflicting or illegal options. I this case,
it is very likely that C<$gsm->{ERROR}> contains an explanation.

=item 0

All is well: operation completed successfully.

=item *

Any other value is either the return code from the call was performed,
in which case the value of C<$gsm->{ERROR}> should have been set to tell
the cause of failure, or it is set to a sensible return code, like the
new location of the item that was added. In that case, C<$gsm->{ERROR}>
will contain something like C<"no error / no data">.

=back

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new ({ attributes })

Returns a new instance of C<GSM::Gnokii>. The attributes are optional.
If attributes are passed, it should be in an anonymous hash. Unknown
attributes are silently ignored.

=over 4

=item verbose

  verbose          => 1,

Will show on STDERR the entry point of functions called

=back

=head2 connect

Connect to the phone.

=head2 disconnect

Disconnects the phone.

=head2 GetProfiles (start, end)

Returns a reference to a list of hashes with profile information, like:

  number           => 1,
  name             => "Tux",
  defaultname      => "Default",
  call_alert       => "Ringing",
  ringtonenumber   => 3,
  volume_level     => "Level 5",
  message_tone     => "Beep once",
  keypad_tone      => "Level 2",
  warning_tone     => "Off",
  vibration        => "On",
  caller_groups    => 2,
  automatic_answer => "Off",

Note that at some models, requesting profile information outside of the
known range might cause the phone to power off.

My own phone timed out on all C<GetProfile> requests.

=head2 GetDateTime

Returns a reference to a hash with two elements, like:

  date             => "2011-01-23 17:22:37",
  timestamp        => 1295799757,

=head2 SetDateTime (timestamp)

Set date and time on device. The C<timestamp> is a unix timestamp as
returned by the C<time> function.

=head2 GetAlarm

Returns a reference to a hash with alarm info, like:

  alarm            => "07:25",
  state            => "off",

  enused           =>     0,

  onused           =>     0,
  phonefree        =>  1902,	# Internal phone memory
  phoneused        =>    98,

been filled with as much as data as available from the entry in the
phone.

The C<type> argument reflects the memory type. See "MEMORYTYPES" below.
The C<start> argument is the first entry to retrieve. Counting starts
at 1, not 0. The C<end> argument may be C<0>, meaning "to the end".

An addressbook entry looks somewhat like:

  memorytype       => "ME",
  location         => 38,

=head2 GetDirTree (memorytype)

Return a reference to a (recursive) list of folders and files in the
phone. The C<memorytype> should be either C<"ME"> for phone memory,
which will descend into C<A:\*>, or C<"SM">, which will descend into
the SIM card C<B:\*>. It will return a hash reference like:

  dir_size         => 128,
  file_count       => 18,
  memorytype       => "ME",
  path             => "A:\\*",
  tree             => [ ... ]

The C<tree> entry in the hash is a list of entries in the folder, of
which each is a reference to a hash with entry information like:

  date             => "2006-01-01 00:00:00",
  file             => undef,
  folder_id        => 0,
  name             => "FIM_punique_id",
  size             => 66,
  type             => "None",

If the entry has a size greater than 0, there might be added a file_id:

  date             => "2005-01-01 12:00:00",
  file             => undef,
  folder_id        => 0,
  id               => "00.00.10.00.01.8e",
  name             => "Flower2.jpg",
  size             => 10203,
  type             => "None",

If the entry is a folder itself, it will be extended with tree info
like in the top node:

  date             => "2006-01-01 00:00:00",
  dir_size         => 128,
  file             => undef,
  file_count       => 13,
  folder_id        => 0,
  name             => "predefgallery",
  path             => "A:\\predefgallery\\*",
  size             => 0,
  tree             => [ ... ]

Note that these calls might take a long time with big trees.

This module just aims to be a perl API to libgnokii. All operations
are done without warranty. Just at own risk. Bugs could exist in this
code, as well as in libgnokii code or in the phone software itself.

Some functionality has not been tested as the phones available for
testing did not support the methods. Not all phones allow all actions,
even basic ones like C<GetProfile> might not be supported on your
mobile device.
